3. Computers talk to specific computers
4. Computers talk to any computer
5. Computers compute
6. Nothing


## Proof-of-Work: A Fiat Shamir Transform from 3 to 5.

Bitcoin trades internal compute (5) for interactivity (1-4). This is what PoW is. Computers use compute, not ACK/VER messaging to achieve consensus.

## Lightning

In LN, you care about which specific peers you have in a network. Bitcoin, thats not the case. 

Non-Interactive LN? 

## BLS Signatures

non-interactive multisig, Signature Aggregation AFTER THE FACT. 

Another level of trading off CPU for less interactivity.
